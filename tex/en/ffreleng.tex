Recently, the Mozilla Release Engineering team has made numerous advances
in release automation for Firefox. We have
reduced the requirements for human involvement during signing and sending
notices to stakeholders, and have automated
many other small manual steps, because each manual step in the process is an
opportunity for human error. While what we have now isn't perfect,
we're always striving to streamline and automate our release
process. Our final goal is to be able to push a button and walk away;
minimal human intervention will eliminate many of the
headaches and do-overs we experienced with our older part-manual,
part-automated release processes. In this chapter, we will explore and
explain the scripts and infrastructure decisions that comprise
the complete Firefox rapid release system, as of Firefox 10.

You'll follow the system from the perspective of a release-worthy
Mercurial changeset as it is turned into a release candidate---and
then a public release---available to over 450 million daily users
worldwide.  We'll start with builds and code signing, then customized
partner and localization repacks, the QA process, and how we generate
updates for every supported version, platform and localization. Each of
these steps must be completed before the release can be pushed out to
Mozilla Community's network of mirrors which provide the downloads to
our users.

We'll look at some of the decisions that have been made to
improve this process; for example, our sanity-checking script that helps
eliminate much of what used to be vulnerable to human error; our
automated signing script; our integration of mobile releases into the
desktop release process; patcher, where updates are created; and AUS (Application Update Service), where updates are
served to our users across multiple versions of the software.

This chapter describes the mechanics of how we generate release builds
for Firefox. Most of this chapter details the significant
steps that occur in a release process once the builds start, but
there is also plenty of complex cross-group communication to deal
with before Release Engineering even starts to generate release
builds, so let's start there.

\begin{aosasect1}{Look \code{N} Ways Before You Start a Release}

\aosafigure[100pt]{../images/ffreleng/gotobuild.png}{Getting from code to ``Go to build''}{fig.ffreleng.getting}

When we started on the project to improve Mozilla's release process,
we began with the premise that the more popular Firefox became, the
more users we would have, and the more attractive a target Firefox would
become to blackhat hackers looking for security vulnerabilities to
exploit. Also, the more popular Firefox became, the more users we
would have to protect from a newly discovered security vulnerability,
so the more important it would be to be able to deliver a security fix as quickly
as possible. We even have a term for this: a ``chemspill''
release\footnote{Short for ``chemical spill''.}. Instead of being surprised by the occasional need for a
chemspill release in between our regularly scheduled releases, we
decided to plan as if every release could be a chemspill release, and
designed our release automation accordingly.

This mindset has three important side-effects:

\begin{aosaenumerate}

\item We do a postmortem after \emph{every} release, and look to see
  where things could be made smoother, easier, and faster next
  time. If at all possible, we find and fix at least one thing,
  no matter how small, immediately---before the next release. This constant
  polishing of our release automation means we're always looking for
  new ways to rely on less human involvement while also improving
  robustness and turnaround time. A lot of effort is spent
  making our tools and processes bulletproof so that ``rare'' events
  like network hiccups, disk space issues or typos made by real live
  humans are caught and handled as early as possible.  Even though
  we're already fast enough for regular, non-chemspill releases, we
  want to reduce the risk of any human error in a future
  release. This is especially true in a chemspill release.

\item When we do have a chemspill release, the more robust the
  release automation, the less stressed the humans in Release
  Engineering are. We're used to the idea of going as fast as
  possible with calm precision, and we've built tools to do
  this as safely and robustly as we know how. Less stress means more
  calm and precise work within a well-rehearsed process, which in turn
  helps chemspill releases go smoothly.

\item We created a Mozilla-wide ``go to build'' process. When doing a
  regular (non-chemspill) release, it's possible to have everyone look
  through the same bug triage queries, see clearly when
  the last fix was landed and tested successfully, and reach consensus on
  when to start builds. However, in a chemspill release---where
  minutes matter---keeping track of all the details of the issue as well as
  following up bug confirmations and fixes gets very tricky very
  quickly.  To reduce complexity and the risk of mistakes, Mozilla
  now has a full-time person 
  to track the readiness of the code for a ``go to build''
  decision. Changing processes
  during a chemspill is risky, so in order to make sure everyone
  is familiar with the process when minutes matter, we use this
  same process for chemspill and regular releases.

\end{aosaenumerate}

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{"Go to Build"}

\begin{aosasect2}{Who Can Send the ``Go to Build''?}

Before the start of the release, one person is designated to assume
responsibility for coordinating the entire release. This person needs to 
attend triage meetings, understand the
background context on all the work being landed, referee bug severity
disputes fairly, approve landing of late-breaking changes, and make
tough back-out decisions.  Additionally, on the actual release day
this person is on point for all communications with the different
groups (developers, QA, Release Engineering, website developers, PR,
marketing, etc.).

Different companies use different titles for this role. Some titles we've heard 
include Release Manager, Release Engineer, Program Manager, Project 
Manager, Product Manager, Product Czar, Release
Driver. In this chapter, we will use the term ``Release Coordinator''
as we feel it most clearly defines the role in our process as described above. 
The important point here is that the role, and the final authority of the role, is
clearly understood by everyone before the release starts, regardless 
of their background or previous work experiences elsewhere. In the 
heat of a release day, it is important tnat everyone knows to abide by, and trust, 
the coordination decisions that this person makes. 

The Release Coordinator is the only person outside of Release
Engineering who is authorized to send ``stop builds'' emails if a
show-stopper problem is discovered. Any reports of
suspected show-stopper problems are redirected to the Release
Coordinator, who will evaluate, make the final go/no-go decision and
communicate that decision to everyone in a timely manner. In the heat 
of the moment of a release day, we all have to abide by, and trust, the 
coordination decisions that this person makes. 

\end{aosasect2}

\begin{aosasect2}{How to Send the ``Go to Build''?}

Early experiments with sending ``go to build'' in IRC channels or
verbally over the phone led to misunderstandings,
occasionally causing problems for the release in progress. Therefore,
we now require that the ``go to build'' signal for every release is
done by email, to a mailing list that includes everyone across all
groups involved in release processes. The subject of the email
includes ``go to build'' and the explicit product name and version
number; for example:

\begin{verbatim}
go to build Firefox 6.0.1
\end{verbatim}

Similarly, if a problem is found in the release, the Release
Coordinator will send a new ``all stop'' email to the same mailing list,
with a new subject line. We found that it was not sufficient to just hit reply
on the most recent email about the release; email threading in some
email clients caused some people to not notice the ``all stop'' email if
it was way down a long and unrelated thread.

\end{aosasect2}

\begin{aosasect2}{What Is In the ``Go to Build'' Email?}

\begin{aosaenumerate}

\item The exact code to be used in the build; ideally, the URL to the
specific change in the source code repository that the release builds are
to be created from.

  \begin{aosaenumerate2}

    \item Instructions like ``use the latest code'' are never acceptable; in one
      release, after the ``go to build'' email was sent and before
      builds started, a well-intentioned developer landed a change,
      without approval, in the wrong branch. The release included that
      unwanted change in the builds. Thankfully the mistake was
      caught before we shipped, but we did have to delay the release 
      while we did a full stop and rebuilt everything.

    \item In a time-based version control system like CVS, be fully
      explicit about the exact time to use; give the time down to seconds,
      and specify timezone. In one release, when Firefox was still
      based on CVS, the Release Coordinator specified the cutoff time
      to be used for the builds but did not give the timezone. By the
      time Release Engineering noticed the missing timezone info, the
      Release Coordinator was asleep. Release
      Engineering correctly guessed that the intent was local time (in
      California), but in a late-night mixup over PDT instead of PST
      we ended up missing the last critical bug fix. This was caught
      by QA before we shipped, but we had to stop builds and
      start the build over using the correct cutoff time.

    \end{aosaenumerate2}

\item A clear sense of the urgency for this particular release.  While
  it sounds obvious, it is important when handling some important edge
  cases, so here is a quick summary:

  \begin{aosaenumerate2}

    \item Some releases are ``routine'', and can be worked on in
      normal working hours. They are a pre-scheduled release, they are
      on schedule, and there is no emergency. Of course, all release
      builds need to be created in a timely manner, but there is no
      need for release engineers to pull all-nighters and burn out
      for a routine release.  Instead, we schedule them
      properly in advance so everything stays on schedule with people
      working normal hours. This keeps people fresh and better able to
      handle unscheduled urgent work if the need arises.

    \item Some releases are ``chemspills'', and are urgent, where minutes matter. These are
      typically to fix a published security exploit, or to fix a
      newly-introduced top-crash problem impacting a large percentage
      of our user base. Chemspills need to be created as
      quickly as possible and are typically not pre-scheduled
      releases.

    \item Some releases change from routine to chemspill or
      from chemspill to routine. For example, if a security
      fix in a routine release was accidentally leaked, it is now
      a chemspill release. If a business requirement like a
      ``special sneak preview'' release for an upcoming
      conference announcement was delayed for business
      reasons, the release now changes from chemspill to
      routine.

    \item Some releases have different people holding different
      opinions on whether the release is normal or urgent,
      depending on their perspective on the fixes being shipped in the
      release.

  \end{aosaenumerate2}

\end{aosaenumerate}

It is the role of the Release Coordinator to balance all the facts and
opinions, reach a decision, and then communicate that decision about
urgency consistently across all groups. If new information arrives,
the Release Coordinator reassesses, and then communicates the new
urgency to all the same groups. Having some groups believe a release
is a chemspill, while other groups believe the same release is routine
can be destructive to cross-group cohesion.

Finally, these emails also became very useful to measure where time
was spent during a release.  While they are only accurate to
wall-clock time resolution, this accuracy is really helpful when
figuring out where next to focus our efforts on making things faster.
As the old adage goes, before you can improve something, you
have to be able to measure it.

Throughout the beta cycle for Firefox we also do weekly releases from
our \code{mozilla-beta}
repository\footnote{\url{http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/}}. Each
one of these beta releases goes through our usual full release
automation, and is treated almost identically to our regular final
releases. To minimize surprises during a release, our intent is to
have no new untested changes to release automation or
infrastructure by the time we start the final release builds.

\end{aosasect2}

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Tagging, Building, and Source Tarballs}

\aosafigure{../images/ffreleng/tagging.png}{Automated tagging}{fig.ffreleng.tagging}
    
In preparation for starting automation, we recently started to use a
script,
\code{release\_sanity.py}\footnote{\url{http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/tools/buildbot-helpers/release_sanity.py}},
that was originally written by a Release Engineering summer intern. This
Python script assists a release engineer with double-checking that all
configurations for a release match what is checked into our tools and
configuration repos.  It also checks what is in the specified release
code revisions for \code{mozilla-release} and all the (human)
languages for this release, which will be what the builds and language
repacks are generated from.

The script accepts the buildbot config files for any release configurations
that will be used (such as desktop or mobile), the branch to look at (e.g.,
\code{mozilla-release}), the build and version number, and the names of the
products that are to be built (such as ``fennec'' or ``firefox''). It will fail if
the release repositories do not
match what's in the configurations, if locale repository changesets don't
match our shipping locales and localization changeset files, or if the
release version and build number don't match what has been given to
our build tools with the tag generated using the product,
version, and build number. If all
the tests in the script pass, it will reconfigure the
buildbot master where the script is being run and where release
builders will be triggered, and then generate the ``send change'' that
starts the automated release process.

After a release engineer kicks off builders,
the first automated step in the Firefox release process is tagging all
the related source code repositories to record which revision of
the source, language repos, and related tools are being used for this
version and build number of a release candidate. 
These tags allow us
to keep a history of Firefox and Fennec (mobile Firefox) releases'
version and build numbers in our release repos.
For Firefox releases, one example tag set is
\code{FIREFOX\_10\_0\_RELEASE FIREFOX\_10\_0\_BUILD1
  FENNEC\_10\_0\_RELEASE FENNEC\_10\_0\_BUILD1}.  

A single Firefox
release uses code from about 85 version control repositories that host
things such as the product code, localization strings, release
automation code, and helper utilities. Tagging all these repositories
is critical to ensure that future steps of the release
automation are all executed using the same set of revisions. It also has a
number of other benefits: Linux distributions and other contributors
can reproduce builds with exactly the same code and tools that go into the
official builds, and it also records the revisions of source and tools
used on a per-release basis for future comparison of what changed
between releases. 
    
Once all the repositories are branched and tagged, a series of dependent builders
automatically start up: one builder for each release platform plus a
source bundle that includes all source used in the release.  The source
bundle and built installers are all uploaded to the release directory
as they become available.  This allows anyone to see exactly what code
is in a release, and gives a snapshot that would allow us to re-create
the builds if we ever needed to (for example, if our VCS failed somehow).
 
%% FIXME (GW): could really use a picture of the repos and connections here 
%% FIXME (GW): You keep putting ``chemspill'' in quotes and re-explaining it.
For the Firefox build's source, sometimes we need to import code
from an earlier repository. For example, with a beta release this means
pulling in the signed-off revision from Mozilla-Aurora (our
more-stable-than-Nightly repo) for Firefox 10.0b1. For a release it
means pulling in the approved changes from Mozilla-Beta (typically the
same code used for 10.0b6) to the Mozilla-Release repository.  This release
branch is then created as a named branch whose parent changeset is
the signed-off revision from the `go to build' provided by the Release
Coordinator. The release branch can be used to make release-specific
modifications to the source code, such as bumping version numbers or
finalizing the set of locales that will be built. If a critical
security vulnerability is discovered in the future that requires an
immediate fix---a chemspill---a minimal set of changes to
address the vulnerability will be landed on this relbranch and a new
version of Firefox generated and released from it. When we have to do another round of
builds for a particular release, buildN, we use these relbranches to
grab the same code that was signed off on for `go to build', which is
where any changes to that release code will have been landed. The
automation starts again and bumps the tagging to the new changeset on
that relbranch.
    
Our tagging process does a \emph{lot} of operations with local and
remote Mercurial repositories. To streamline some of the most
common operations we've written a few tools to assist us:
\code{retry.py}\footnote{\url{http://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/file/7adc08bd1386/lib/python/util/retry.py}}
and
\code{hgtool.py}\footnote{\url{http://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/file/a0fce0162fd5/scripts/hgtool.py}}.
\code{retry.py} is a simple wrapper that can take a given command and
run it, retrying several times if it fails. It can also watch for
exceptional output conditions and retry or report failure in those
cases. We've found it useful to wrap \code{retry.py} around most of the
commands which can fail due to external dependencies.  For tagging,
the Mercurial operations could fail due to temporary network outages, web
server issues, or the back end Mercurial server being temporarily
overloaded. Being able to automatically retry these operations and
continue saves a lot of our time, since we don't have to manually
recover, clean up any fallout and then get the release automation running again.
    
\code{hgtool.py} is a utility that encapsulates several common Mercurial
operations, like cloning, pulling, and updating with a single invocation. It
also adds support for Mercurial's share extension, which we use extensively
to avoid having several full clones of repositories in
different directories on the same machine.  Adding support for shared
local repositories significantly sped up our tagging process, since most
full clones of the product and locale repositories could be avoided.
    
An important motivation for developing tools like these is 
making our automation as testable as possible. Because tools like
\code{hgtool.py} are small, single-purpose utilities built on top of
reusable libraries, they're much easier to test in isolation.

Today our tagging is done in two parallel jobs: one for desktop
Firefox which takes around 20 minutes to complete as it includes
tagging 80+ locale repos, and another for mobile Firefox which takes
around 10 minutes to complete since we have fewer locales currently
available for our mobile releases. In the future we would like to
streamline our release automation process so that we tag \emph{all}
the various repositories in parallel. The initial builds can be
started as soon as the product code and tools requirement
repository is tagged, without having to wait for all the locale
repositories to be tagged. By the time these builds are finished, the
rest of the repositories will have been tagged so that localization
repackages and future steps can be completed.  We estimate this can
reduce the total time to have builds ready by 15 minutes.

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Localization Repacks and Partner Repacks}

\aosafigure{../images/ffreleng/repacksl10n.png}{Repacking Firefox for each localization}{fig.ffreleng.repack}

Once the desktop builds are generated and uploaded to
\code{ftp.mozilla.org}, our automation triggers the localization
repackaging jobs. A ``localization repack'' takes the original 
build (which contains the en-US locale), unpacks it, replaces
the en-US strings with the strings for another locale that we
are shipping in this release, then repackages all the files back
up again (this is why we call them repacks). We repeat this 
for each locale shipping in the release. Originally, we did all 
repacks serially. However, as we added more locales, this took 
a long time to complete, and we had to restart from the beginning 
if anything failed out mid-way through. 

Now, we instead split the entire set of repacks into
six jobs, each processed concurrently on six
different machines. This approach completes the work in
approximately a sixth of the time. This also allows us to redo
a subset of repacks if an individual repack fails, without
having to redo all repacks. (We could split the repacks into
even more, smaller, concurrent jobs, but we found it took away
too many machines from the pool, which affected other unrelated
jobs triggered by developers on our continuous integration
system.) 
    
The process for mobile (on Android) is slightly different, as we produce
only two installers:  an English version and a multi-locale version 
with over a dozen languages built into the installer
instead of a separate build per locale. The size of this
multi-locale version is an issue, especially with slow
download speeds onto small mobile devices. One proposal for
the future is to have other languages be requested on demand
as add-ons from \code{addons.mozilla.org}.

In \aosafigref{fig.ffreleng.repack}, you can see that we currently rely
on three different sources for our locale information:
\code{shipped\_locales}, \code{l10\_changesets} and
\code{l10n-changesets\_mobile-release.json}. (There is a plan to move
all three into a unified JSON file.) These files contain information
about the different localizations we have, and certain platform
exceptions. Specifically, for a given localization we need to know
which revision of the repository to use for a given release and we
need to know if the localization can build on all of our supported
platforms (e.g.,  Japanese for Mac comes from a different repository all
together).  Two of these files are used for the Desktop releases and
one for the Mobile release (this JSON file contains both the list of
platforms and the changesets).

Who decides which languages we ship? First of all, localizers
themselves nominate their specific changeset for a given release. The
nominated changeset gets reviewed by Mozilla's localization team and
shows up in a web dashboard that lists the changesets needed for each
language. The Release Coordinator reviews this before sending the ``go
to build'' email. On the day of a release, we retrieve this list of
changesets and we repackage them accordingly.

Besides localization repackages we also generate partner
repackages. These are customized builds for various partners we have
who want to customize the experience for their customers.  The main
type of changes are custom bookmarks, custom homepage and custom
search engines but many other things can be changed. These customized
builds are generated for the latest Firefox release and not for betas.

\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Signing}

In order for users to be sure that the copy of Firefox they have
downloaded is indeed the unmodified build from Mozilla, we apply a few different
types of digital signatures to the builds.

The first type of signing is for our Windows builds. We use a
Microsoft Authenticode (signcode) signing key to sign all our
\code{.exe} and \code{.dll} files. Windows can use these signatures to
verify that the application comes from a trusted source. We also sign
the Firefox installer executable with the Authenticode key. 

Next we use GPG to generate a set of MD5 and SHA1 checksums for
all the builds on all platforms, and generate detached GPG
signatures for the checksum files as well as all the builds and installers.
These signatures are used by mirrors and other community members
to validate their downloads.

For security purposes, we sign on a dedicated signing machine that is
blocked off via firewall and VPN from outside connections. Our
keyphrases, passwords, and keystores are passed among release
engineers only in secure channels, often in person, to minimize the
risk of exposure as much as possible.

\aosafigure[325pt]{../images/ffreleng/signing.png}{Signing Firefox installers}{fig.ffreleng.signing}

Until recently this signing process involved a release engineer
working on a dedicated server (the ``signing master'') for almost an
hour manually downloading builds, signing them, and
uploading them back to \code{ftp.mozilla.org} before the automation could
continue.  Once signing on the master was completed and all files were
uploaded, a log file of all the signing activities was uploaded to
the release candidates directory on \code{ftp.mozilla.org}.  The appearance
of this log file on \code{ftp.mozilla.org} signified the end of human signing
work and from that point, dependent builders watching for that log
file could resume automation.  Recently we've added an additional
wrapper of automation around the signing steps. Now the release engineer 
opens a Cygwin shell on the signing master
and sets up a few environment variables pertaining to the release, like
\code{VERSION}, \code{BUILD}, \code{TAG}, and \code{RELEASE\_CONFIG}, that
help the script find the right directories on \code{ftp.mozilla.org} and know
when all the deliverables for a release have been downloaded so that
the signing can start. After checking out the most recent production
version of our signing tools, the release engineer simply runs
\code{make autosign}. The release engineer then enters two
passphrases, one for gpg and one for signcode. Once these passphrases
are automatically verified by the make scripts, the automation
starts a download loop that watches for uploaded builds and repacks
from the release automation and downloads them as they become
available.  Once all items have been downloaded, the automation
begins signing immediately, without human intervention. 

Not needing a
human to sign is important for two reasons. Firstly, it reduces the
risk of human error. Secondly, it allows signing to
proceed during non-work hours, without needing a release engineer
awake at a computer at the time.  

All deliverables have an MD5SUM and SHA1SUM generated for them, and
those hash values are written to files of the same name.  These files
will be uploaded back to the release-candidates directory as well as
synced into the final location of the release on \code{ftp.mozilla.org} once
it is live, so that anyone who downloads a Firefox installer from one of our
mirrors can ensure they got the correct object. When all signed bits
are available and verified 
 they are uploaded back to \code{ftp.mozilla.org} along
with the signing log file, which the automation is waiting for to
proceed.


Our next planned round of improvements to the signing process
will create a tool that allows us to sign bits at the time of
build/repack. This work requires creating a signing server
application that can receive requests to sign files from
the release build machines.  It will also
require a signing client tool which would contact the signing
server, authenticate itself as a machine trusted to request signing,
upload the files to be signed, wait for the build to be signed,
download the signed bits, and then include them as part of the
packaged build.  Once these enhancements are in production, we can
discontinue our current all-at-once signing process, as well as our
all-at-once generate-updates process (more on this below). We expect this
work to trim a few hours off our current end-to-end times for a
release.
  
\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Updates}

Updates are created so users can update to the latest version of
Firefox quickly and easily using our built-in updater, without having
to download and run a standalone installer.
From the user's perspective, the downloading of the update
package happens quietly in the background. Only after the update files
are downloaded, and ready to be applied, will Firefox prompt the user
with the option to apply the update and restart.

%% QUERY: We need an explanation of what a "release train" is and what the
%% different release trains are, either here or somewhere earlier in the 
%% section.
The catch is, we generate a \emph{lot} of updates. For any given release
train, we generate updates from all supported previous releases along
that release train to the new latest release for that train.  For Firefox \code{LATEST}, that
means generating updates for every platform, every locale, and every
installer from Firefox \code{LATEST-1}, \code{LATEST-2}, \code{LATEST-3}, {\ldots} 
 in both complete and partial forms. We do all this for several
release trains at a time.

%% QUERY: What does "bumps" mean here? Increments? Uploads? Downloads? --ARB
Our update generation automation bumps the update configuration files
of each release's build off a branch to maintain our canonical list of
what version numbers, platforms, and localizations need to have
updates created to offer users this newest release. We offer updates
as ``snippets''. As you can see in the example below, this snippet is
simply an XML pointer file hosted on our AUS (Application Update
Service) that informs the user's Firefox browser where the complete
and/or partial \code{.mar} (Mozilla Archive) files are hosted.

\caption{Sample Update Snippet}
\label{fig.ffreleng.snippet}
\end{figure}

As you can see in \aosafigref{fig.ffreleng.snippet}, update snippets
have a \code{type} attribute which can be either \code{major} or 
\code{minor}.
Minor updates keep people updated to the latest version
available in their release train; for example, it would update all
3.6.* release users to the latest 3.6 release, all rapid-release beta
users to the latest beta, all Nightly users to the
latest Nightly build, etc.  Most of the time, updates are minor and
don't require any user interaction other than a confirmation to apply the
update and restart the browser.

Major updates are used when we need to advertise to our users that the
latest and greatest release is available, prompting them that
``A new version of Firefox is available, would you
like to update?'' and displaying a billboard showcasing the leading 
features in the new release.  Our new rapid-release system means we no
longer need to do as many major updates; we'll be able to stop
generating major updates once the 3.6.* release train is no longer supported.

\begin{aosasect2}{Complete Updates vs.\ Partial Updates}

At build time we generate ``complete update'' \code{.mar} files which
contain all the files for the new release, compressed with \code{bz2}
and then archived into a \code{.mar} file. Both complete and partial
updates are downloaded automatically through the update channel a user
is on.
%% QUERY: Do we know what an "update channel" is? --ARB

Partial update .mar files are created by comparing the complete .mar for the
old release with the complete .mar for the new release to create a
``partial-update'' \code{.mar} file containing the binary diff of any
changed files, and a manifest file. As you can see in the sample
snippet in \aosafigref{fig.ffreleng.snippet}, this results in a much smaller file size for partial
updates. This is very important for users with slower or
dialup Internet connections.

In older versions of our update automation the generation of partial
updates for all locales and platforms could take six to seven hours for one
release, as the complete .mar files were downloaded, diffed, and packaged into a
partial-update .mar file. Eventually it was discovered that even
across platforms, many component changes were identical, therefore many diffs could be re-used. With a
script that cached the hash for each part of the diff, our partial
update creation time was brought down to approximately 40 minutes. 

After the snippets are
uploaded and are hosted on AUS, an update verification step is run to
a) test downloading the snippets and b) run the updater with the
downloaded .mar file to confirm that the updates apply correctly.

Generation of partial-update .mar files, as well as all the update snippets,
is currently done after signing is complete. We do this because
generation of the partial updates must be done between signed files of
the two releases, and therefore generation of the snippets must wait
until the signed builds are available.  Once we're able to integrate
signing into the build process, we can generate partial updates
immediately after completing a build or repack. Together with
improvements to our AUS software, this means that once we're finished
builds and repacks we would be able to push immediately to
mirrors. This effectively parallelizes the creation of all the
updates, trimming several hours from our total time.

\begin{aosasect1}{Pushing to Internal Mirrors and QA}

Verifying that the release process is producing the expected
deliverables is key. This
is accomplished by QA's verification and sign offs process.

Once the signed builds are available, QA starts manual and automated
testing. QA relies on a mix of community members,
contractors and employees in different timezones to speed up this
verification process. Meanwhile, our release automation generates
updates for all languages and all platforms, for all supported
releases.  These update snippets are typically ready before QA 
has finished verifying the signed builds. QA then verifies that users 
can safely update from various previous releases to the newest 
release using these updates. 

Mechanically, our automation pushes the binaries to our ``internal
mirrors'' (Mozilla-hosted servers) in order for QA to verify
updates. Only after QA has finished verification of the builds and
the updates will we push them to our
community mirrors. These community mirrors are essential to
handle the global load of users, by allowing them to request their updates
from local mirror nodes instead of from \code{ftp.mozilla.org}
directly. It's worth noting that we do not make builds and updates
available on the community mirrors until after QA signoff, because of
complications that arise if QA finds a last-minute showstopper
and the candidate build needs to be withdrawn.

The validation process after builds and updates are generated is:

\begin{aosaitemize}

\item QA, along with community and contractors in other timezones, does
  manual testing.

\item QA triggers the automation systems to do functional testing.

\item QA independently verifies that fixed problems and new
  features for that release are indeed fixed and of good enough
  quality to ship to users.

\item Meanwhile, release automation generates the updates.

\item QA signs off the builds.

\item QA signs off the updates.

\end{aosaitemize}
  
Note that users don't get updates until QA has signed off and the
Release Coordinator has sent the email asking to push the builds and
updates live.
 
\end{aosasect1}

\begin{aosasect1}{Pushing to Public Mirrors and AUS}

Once the Release Coordinator gets signoff from QA and various
other groups at Mozilla, they give
Release Engineering the go-ahead to push the files to our
community mirror network. We rely on our community mirrors to be
able to handle a few hundred million users downloading updates
over the next few days. All the installers, as well as the complete 
and partial updates for all platforms and locales, are already on our
internal mirror network at this point. Publishing the files to
our external mirrors involves making a change to an rsync exclude file
for the public mirrors module.  Once this change is made, the
mirrors will start to synchronize the new release files. Each     
mirror has a score or weighting associated with it; we monitor which mirrors have
synchronized the files and sum their individual scores to compute a
total ``uptake'' score. Once a certain uptake threshold is reached, we notify
the Release Coordinator that the mirrors have enough uptake to handle
the release.

This is the point at which the release becomes ``official''. After the
Release Coordinator sends the final ``go live'' email, Release
Engineering will update the symlinks on the web server so that
visitors to our web and ftp sites can find the latest new version of
Firefox. We also publish all the update snippets for users on past versions of
Firefox to AUS. 

Firefox installed on users' machines regularly checks our AUS
servers to see if there's an updated version of Firefox available for
them. Once we publish these update snippets, users are able to
automatically update Firefox to the latest version.
