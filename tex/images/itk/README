The files with extension .dia were generated by the Dia application.

                   http://projects.gnome.org/dia/

From Dia, the figures were exported as EPS, in files with .eps extension.

These files were then converted to PDF by using the command:

                      epstopdf    figure.eps

For convenience, the resulting .pdf file has been committed to this
SVN repository. However, the actual source of the diagrams are the
files with extensions .dia.
