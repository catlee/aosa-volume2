gpsd.tex: TeX master for the GPSD chapter

software-layers.pic:
    pic diagram illustrating the vertical software layering

dataflow.pic:
    pic diagram illustrating the flow of sensor data

I know it's possible to embed pic diagrams in LaTeX, but I never learned

picture-environment commands rather than troff.  I've just left comments
in the chapter where the diagrams should go.
