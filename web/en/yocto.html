Yocto Project™ is an open source collaborative project that
provides a common starting point for developers of embedded Linux
systems to create customized distributions for embedded products in a
hardware agnostic setting. Sponsored by the Linux Foundation™,
Yocto is more than a build system. It provides tools, processes,
templates and methods for developers to rapidly create and deploy
products for the embedded market. One of the core components of
Yocto, is the Poky Build system. As Poky is a large and complex
system, we will be focusing on one of it's core components, BitBake.
BitBake is a Gentoo Portage inspired build tool, used by both the
Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded communities to utilize metadata in
order to create Linux images from source.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.0 Introduction and History</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 2001, Sharp Corporation introduced
the SL-5000 PDA, named Zaurus, which ran an embedded Linux
distribution, Lineo. Not long after the Zaurus's introduction, Chris
Larson founded the OpenZaurus Project, a replacement Linux
distribution for the SharpROM, based on a build system called
buildroot. With the founding of the project, people began
contributing many more software packages, as well as targets for
other devices, and it wasn't long that the build system for
OpenZaurus began to show fragility. In January 2003, the community
began discussing a new build system to incorporate the community
usage model of a generic build system for embedded Linux
distributions. This would eventually become OpenEmbedded. Chris
Larson, Michael Lauer, and Holger Schurig began work on OpenEmbedded
by porting hundreds of OpenZaurus packages over to the new build
system.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yocto Project springs from this
work. At the project's core is the Poky build system, created by
Richard Purdie. It began as a stabilized branch of OpenEmbedded using
a core subset of the thousands of OpenEmbedded recipes, across a
limited set of architectures. Over time, it slowly coalesced into
more than just an embedded build system, but into a complete software
development platform, with an Eclipse plugin, a fakeroot replacement
and QEMU based images. Around November 2010, the Linux Foundation
announced that this work would all continue under the heading of the
Yocto Project as a Linux Foundation sponsored project. It was then
established that Yocto and OpenEmbedded would coordinate on a core
set of package metadata called OE-Core combining the best of both
Poky and OpenEmbedded with an increased use of layering for
additional components. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.1 Introduction to the Poky Build System</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The
Poky build system is the core of the Yocto Project. In Poky's default
configuration, it can provide a starting image footprint that ranges
from a shell accessible minimal image all the way up to a Linux
Standard Base compliant image with a GNOME Mobile and Embedded (GMAE)
based reference user interface called Sato. From these base image
types, metadata layers can be added to extend functionality; layers
can provide an additional software stack for an image type, add a
board support package (BSP) for additional hardware or even represent
a new image type.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using the 1.1 release of Poky, named
“edison” (available at
<A HREF="http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-1.1/poky-edison-6.0.tar.bz2">http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-1.1/poky-edison-6.0.tar.bz2</A>
) we will show how BitBake utilizes these recipes and configuration
files to generate an embedded image. From a very high level, the
build process starts out by setting up the shell environment for the
build run. This is done by sourcing a file, oe-init-build-env, that
exists in the root of the poky source tree. This sets up the shell
environment, creates an initial customizable set of configuration
files and wraps the BitBake runtime with a shell script that Poky
uses to determine if the minimal system requirements have been met. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, one of the things it will
look for is the existence of Pseudo, a fakeroot replacement
contributed to the Yocto Project by Wind River Systems. At this
point, 'bitbake core-image-minimal', for example, should be able to
create a fully functional cross compilation environment and then
create a Linux image based on the image definition for
&quot;core-image-minimal&quot; from source as defined in the yocto
metadata layer.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the creation of our image,
BitBake will parse it's configuration, include any additional layers,
classes, tasks or recipes defined and begin by creating a weighted
dependency chain. This process provides an ordered and weighted task
priority map. BitBake then uses this map to determine what packages
must be built in which order in order to most efficiently fulfill
compilation dependencies. Tasks needed by the most other tasks are
weighted higher and thus, run earlier during the build process. The
task execution queue for our build is created. BitBake also stores
the parsed metadata summaries and if on subsequent runs, it
determines that the metadata has changed, it can re-parse only what
has changed. The BitBake scheduler and parser are some of the more
interesting architectural designs of BitBake and some of the
decisions surrounding them and their implementation by BitBake
contributors are ones we will be discussing later.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="../images/yocto/aosa1.jpg" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=454 HEIGHT=588 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><I>Figure&nbsp;</I><I>0</I><I>.0:
Poky build process</I><BR><BR>BitBake then runs through it's weighted
task queue, spawning threads (up to the number defined by
BB_NUMBER_THREADS in conf/local.conf) that begin executing those
tasks in the predetermined order. The tasks executed during a
package's build may be modified, prepended or appended to through
it's recipe. The basic, default package task order of execution
starts by fetching and unpacking package source and then configuring
and cross-compiling the unpacked source. The compiled source is then
split up into packages and various calculations are made on the
compilation result such as the creation of debug package information.
The split up packages are then packaged into a supported package
format; rpm, ipk or deb package formats being supported. BitBake will
then use these packages to build the root file system.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.1.1 Poky Build System Concepts</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the most powerful aspects of the
Poky build system is that every aspect of a build is controlled by
metadata. Metadata can be loosely grouped into configuration files or
package recipes. <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">A recipe is a
collection of</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">non-executable
metadata used by BitBake to set variables or define additional build
time tasks. A recipe contains fields such as the recipe description,
the recipe version, the license of the package and the upstream
source repository are set. It may also</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">indicate
that the build process utilizes autotools, make, distutils or any
other build process, in which case, the basic functionality can be
defined by classes it inherits</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">from
the OE-Core layers class definitions in ./meta/classes.</SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Additional tasks can also be
defined, as well as task prerequisites.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">BitBake
also</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">supports both _prepend
and _append as a method of extending task functionality by injecting
code indicated by using prepend or append suffix into the beginning
or end of a</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">task.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Configuration
files </SPAN>can be broken down into two types. Those that configure
BitBake and the overall build run, and those that configure the
various layers Poky uses to create different configurations of a
target image. A layer is any grouping of metadata that provides some
sort of additional functionality. These can be BSP for new devices,
additional image types or additional software outside of the core
layers. In fact, the core Yocto metadata, meta-yocto, is itself a
layer applied on top of the OE-Core metadata layer, meta which adds
additional software and image types to the OE-Core layer. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An example of how one would use
layering is by creating a NAS device for the Intel n660 (Crownbay),
utilizing x32, the new 32-bit native ABI for x86-64, with a custom
software layer that adds a user interface. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given the task at hand, we could split
this functionality out into layers. At the lowest level we would
utilize a BSP layer for Crownbay that would enable Crownbay-specific
hardware functionality, such as video drivers. As we want x32, we
would use the experimental meta-x32 layer. The NAS functionality
would be layered on top of this by adding the Yocto Project's example
NAS layer, meta-baryon. And lastly, we'll use an imaginary layer
called meta-myproject, to provide the software and configuration to
create a graphical user interface to enable configuration of the NAS.</P>

<P>During the setup of the BitBake environment, by sourcing

and what Poky generates. The first of these configuration files is
bblayers.conf. This file is what we will use to add additional layers
in order to build our example project.</P>

as our example layer, we want to examine the layer configuration

initial parsing of bblayers.conf. From here it adds additional

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the BitBake configuration files
help generate BitBake's datastore which is utilized during the
creation of the task execution queue. During the beginning of a
build, BitBake's BBCooker class is started. The cooker manages the
build task execution by 'baking' the 'recipes'. One of the first
things the cooker does is attempt to load and parse configuration
data. Remember, though, that BitBake is looking for two types of
configuration data. In order to tell the build system where it should
find this configuration data (and in turn where to find recipe
metadata), the cooker's parseConfigurationFiles method is called.
With few exceptions, the first configuration files that the cooker
looks for is bblayers.conf, whose main purpose is to set up global
build time variables, such as directory structure naming for various
rootfs directories, the initial LDFLAGS to be used during compile
time. Most end users will never touch this file as most anything
needed to be changed here would be within a recipe context as opposed
to build wide. As this file is parsed, BitBake also includes
configuration files that are relative to each layer in BBLAYERS and
adds the variables found in those files to it's data store.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">1.2 BitBake Architecture</H2>
<P>Before we delve into some of BitBake's current architectural
design, it would help to understand how BitBake once worked. For
this, in order to fully appreciate how far BitBake has come, we will
use the initial version, BitBake 1.0. In that first release of
BitBake, a build's dependency chain was determined based upon recipe
dependencies. If something failed during the build of an image,
BitBake would move on to the next task and try to run it again later.
What this means, obviously, is that builds took a very long time. One
of the things BitBake also did is keep each and every variable that a
recipe used in one very large dictionary. Given the number of recipes
and the number of variables and tasks needed to accomplish a build,
BitBake 1.0 was a memory hog. At a time when memory was expensive and
systems did not have much, builds could be painful affairs. It was
not unheard of for a system to run out of memory (writing to swap!)
as it slugged through a long running build. In it's first
incarnation, while it did the job (sometimes), it did it slowly while
consuming enormous resources. Worse, as BitBake 1.0 had no concept of
a data persistence cache or shared state, it also had no ability to
do incremental builds. So if a build failed, one would have to
restart it from scratch. 
</P>
<P>A quick diff between the current BitBake version used in Poky
“edison” 1.13.3 and 1.0 shows the implementation of BitBake's
client-server architecture, the data persistence cache, it's
datastore, a copy-on-write improvement for the datastore, shared
state implementation and drastic improvements over how it determines
task and package dependency chains. This evolution has made it more
reliable, more efficient and more dynamic. Much of this functionality
came out of necessity for quicker more reliable builds that used less
resources. Three improvements to BitBake that we will examine is the
implementation of a client-server architecture, optimizations around
BitBake's data storage and work done around how BitBake determines
it's build and task dependency chain. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.2.1 BitBake IPC</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since we now know a good deal about how
the Poky build system utilizes configurations, recipes and layers to
create embedded images, we're prepared to begin to look under the
hood of BitBake and examine how this is all combined. Starting with
the core BitBake executable, bitbake/bin/bake, we can begin to see
the process BitBake takes as it begins to set up the infrastructure
needed to begin a build. The first item of interest is BitBake's
Interprocess Communications (IPC). Initially, BitBake had no actual
concept of a client-server. This functionality was factored into the
BitBake design over a period of time in order to allow BitBake to run
multiple processes during a build, as it was initially single
threaded, and to allow different user experiences.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Poky builds are begun by starting a
user interface instance. The user interface provides a mechanism for
logging of build output, build status and build progress as well as
receiving events from build tasks through the BitBake event module.
The default user interface used is knotty, BitBake's command line
interface. Called knotty, or “(no) tty”, since it handles both
ttys and non-ttys, it is one of a few interfaces that are supported.
One of these additional user interfaces is Hob. Hob is the graphical
interface to BitBake, a kind of “BitBake commander”. In addition
to the typical functions you would see in the knotty user interface,
hob, written by Joshua Lock, brings the ability to modify
configuration files, add additional layers and packages, and fully
customize a build.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BitBake user interfaces have the
ability to send commands to the next module brought up by the BitBake
executable, the BitBake server. Like the user interface, BitBake also
supports multiple different server types, amongst them XMLRPC. The
default server that most users use when executing BitBake from the
knotty user interface is BitBake's process server. After bringing up
the server, the BitBake executable brings up the cooker. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cooker is a core portion of BitBake
and is where most of the particularly interesting things that occur
during a Poky build are called from. The cooker is what manages the
parsing of metadata, initiates the generation of the dependency and
task trees, and manages the build. One of the functions of BitBake's
server architecture is allowing multiple ways of exposing the command
API, indirectly, to the user interface. The command module is the
worker of BitBake, running build command and triggering events that
get passed up to the user interface through BitBakes event handler.
Once the cooker is brought up from the BitBake executable, it
initializes the BitBake datastore and then begins to parse all of
Poky's configuration files. It then creates the runqueue object, and
triggers off the build.

<H2 CLASS="western">1.2.2 BitBake DataSmart copy-on-write data
storage</H2>
<P>In BitBake 1.0, all BitBake variables were parsed and stored in
one very large dictionary during the initialization of that version's
data class. As previously mentioned, this was problematic, in that
very large python dictionaries are slow on writes and member access
and if the build host runs out of physical memory during the build,
we end up hitting swap. While this is less likely in most systems in
late 2011, when OpenEmbedded and BitBake were first starting up, the
average computer's specification did not generally have more than one
or two gigabytes of memory, and usually, quite less.</P>
<P>This was one of the major pain points in early BitBake. Two major
issues needed to be worked out in order to help increase performance.
One was precomputation of the build dependency chain. The other was
to reduce the size of data being stored in memory. As much of the
data being stored for a recipe doesn't change from recipe to recipe,
for example, TMPDIR, BB_NUMBER_THREADS and other global BitBake
variables, having a copy of the entire data environment per recipe
stored in memory was inefficient. The solution was Tom Ansell's
copy-on-write dictionary that “abuses classes to be nice and fast”.
BitBake's COW module is both an especially fearless and clever hack.
Running 'python BitBake/lib/bb/COW.py' and examining the module will
give you an idea of how this copy-on-write implementation works and
how BitBake uses it to store data efficiently</P>
<P>The DataSmart module, which utilizes the COW dictionary, stores
the data from the initial poky configuration, data from .conf files
and .bbclass files, in a dict as a data object. Each of these objects
can contain another data object of just the diff of the data. So if a
recipe changes something from the initial data configuration, instead
of copying the entire configuration in order to localize it, a diff
of the parent data object is stored at the next layer down in the in
the COW stack. When an attempt is made to access a variable, the data
module will use DataSmart to look into the top level of the stack. If
the variable is not found it will defer to a lower level of the stack
until it does find the variable or errors out.</P>
<P>One of the other interesting things about the DataSmart module
centers around variable expansion. As BitBake variables can contain
executable python, one of the things that needs to be done is the
variable needs to be run through BitBakes bb.codeparser to ensure
that it's valid python and that it contains no circular references.
An example of a variable containing python is this example taken from
./meta/conf/distro/include/tclibc-eglibc.inc:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LIBCEXTENSION = &quot;${@['',
'-gnu'][(d.getVar('ABIEXTENSION', True) or '') != '']}&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P>This variable is included from one of the OE-Core configuration
files, ./meta/conf/distro/include/defaultsetup.conf and is used to
provide a set of default options across different distro
configurations that one would want to lay on top of Poky or
OpenEmbedded. This file imports some eglibc specific variables that
are set dependent on the value of another BitBake variable
ABIEXTENSION. During the creation of the datastore, the python within
this variable needs to be parsed and validated to ensure tasks that
utilize this variable will not fail.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.2.3 BitBake Scheduler</H2>
<P>Once BitBake has parsed the configuration and created it's
datastore, it needs to parse the recipes required for the image and
produce a build chain. This is one of the more substantial
improvements to BitBake. Originally, BitBake took it's build
priorities from a recipe. If a recipe had a DEPENDS, it would try to
figure out what to build in order to satisfy that dependency. If a
task failed because it lacked a prerequisite needed for it's
buildout, it was simply put to the side and attempted later. This had
obvious drawbacks, both in efficiency and reliability.</P>
<P>As no precomputed dependency chain was established, task execution
order was figured out during the build run. This limited BitBake to
being single threaded as at no time. To give an idea of how painful
single threaded BitBake builds can be, the smallest image
“core-image-minimal” on a standard developer machine in 2011
(<EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Core</SPAN></EM>™ <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">i7,
16 gigabytes of DDR3 memory) takes about three or four hours to build
a complete cross compilation toolchain and use it to produce packages
that are then used to create an image. For reference, a build on the
same machine with BB_NUMBER_THREADS at 14 and PARALLEL_MAKE set to
“-j 12” takes about 30 to 40 minutes. As one could imagine
running single threaded with no precomputed order of task execution
on slower hardware that had less memory with a large portion wasted
by duplicate copies of the entire datastore took much longer.</SPAN></EM></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.2.3.1 Dependencies</H2>
<P>When we talk of build dependencies, we need to make a distinction
between the various types. A build dependency, or DEPENDS, is
something we require as a prerequisite so that Poky can build the
required package, whereas a runtime dependency, RDEPENDS, requires
that the image the package is to be installed on also contain the
package listed as an RDEPENDS. Take, for example, the package
task-core-boot. If we look at the recipe for it in
meta/recipes-core/tasks/task-core-boot.bb we will see two BitBake
variables set. RDEPENDS and DEPENDS. BitBake uses these two fields
during the creation of it's dependency chain. 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">DEPENDS = &quot;virtual/kernel&quot;
<BR>...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">RDEPENDS_task-core-boot = &quot;\

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier 10 Pitch">...</FONT></P>
<P><I>Figure 7.0: Portion of task-core-boot.bb showing DEPENDS and
RDEPENDS</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Packages aren't the only thing in
BitBake with dependencies. Tasks also have their own dependencies.
Within the scope of BitBake's runqueue, we recognize four types:
Internally dependent, DEPENDS dependent, RDEPENDS dependent and
inter-task dependent.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Internally dependent tasks are set
within a recipe and add a task before and/or after another task. For
example, in a recipe, we could add a task called “do_deploy” by
adding the line 'addtask deploy before do_build after do_compile'.
This would add a dependency for running the do_deploy task prior to
do_build being started, but after do_compile is completed. DEPENDS
and RDEPENDS dependent tasks are tasks that run after a denoted task.
For example, if we wanted to run do_deploy of a package after the
do_install of it's DEPENDS or RDEPENDS, our recipe would include
“do_deploy[deptask] = 'do_install' “ or “do_deploy[rdeptask] =
'do_install' “. For inter-task dependencies, if we wanted a taks to
be dependant on a different package's task we would add, using the
above example of do_deploy, do_deploy[depends] = “&lt;target's
name&gt;:do_install”. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.2.3.2 RunQueue</H2>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">As an image build out can have
hundreds of recipes, each with multiple packages and task, each of
with it's own dependency, BitBake is now tasked with trying to sort
this out into something it can use as an order of execution. A</SPAN>fter
the cooker has gotten the entire list of packages needed to be built
from the initialization of the bb.data object, it will begin to
create a weighted task map from this data in ordered to produce an
ordered list of tasks it needs to run, called the runqueue. Once the
runqueue is created, BitBake can begin executing it in priority
order, tasking out each portion to a different thread.</P>
<P>Within the provider module, BitBake will first look to see if
there is a PREFERRED_PROVIDER for a given package or image. As more
than one recipe can provide a given package and as tasks are defined
in recipes, BitBake needs to decide which provider of a package it
will use. It will sort all the providers of the package, weighting
each provider by various criteria. For example, preferred versions of
software will get a higher priority than others, however, BitBake
also takes into account package version as well as the dependencies
of other packages. Once it has selected the recipe from which it will
derive it's package, BitBake will iterate over the DEPENDS and
RDEPENDS of that recipe and proceed to compute the providers for
those packages. This chain reaction will produce a list of packages
need to for image generation as well as providers for those packages.</P>
<P>Runqueue now has a full list of all packages needed to be built
and a dependency chain. In order to begin execution of the build, the
runqueue module now needs to create the TaskData object in order to
begin to sort out a weighted task map. It begins by taking each
buildable package it has found, spliting out the tasks needed to
generate that package and weighing each of those tasks based upon the
number of packages that require it. Tasks with a higher weight have
more dependants, and therefore are generally run earlier in the
build. Once this is complete, the runqueue module then prepares to
convert the TaskData object into a runqueue.</P>
<P>The creation of the runqueue is somewhat complex. BitBake first
iterates through the list of task names within the TaskData object in
order to determine task dependencies. As it iterates through
TaskData, it begins to build a weighted task map. When it is
complete, if it has found no circular dependencies, unbuildable tasks
or any such problems, it will then order the task map by weight and
return a complete runqueue object to the cooker. The cooker will
begin to attempt to execute the runqueue, task by task. Depending
upon image size and computing resources, Poky may take from a half
hour to hours in order to generate a cross compilation toolchain, a
package feed and the embedded Linux image specified. It is worth
noting that from the time of executing 'bitbake &lt;image_name&gt;'
from the commandline, the entire process up to right before the
execution of the task execution queue has taken less than a few
seconds.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.3 Conclusion</H2>
<P>In my discussions with community members and my own personal
observations, I've identified a few areas where things should have
perhaps been done differently as well as a few valuable lessons. It
is important to note, that “arm chair quarterbacking” a decade
long development effort is not meant as a criticism of those who've
poured their time and effort into a wholly remarkable collection of
software. As developers, the most difficult part of our job is
predicting what we will need years down the road and how we can set
up a frame work to enable that work now. Few can achieve that without
some road bumps. 
</P>
<P>The first lesson I would point out is to make sure to develop a
written, agreed upon standards document exists and that is well
understood by the community. It should be designed for maximum
flexibility and growth. One place where I've personally run into this
issue is with my work in OE-Core's license manifest creation class,
especially with my experiences working with the LICENSE variable. 
</P>
<P>As no clearly documented standard existed for what LICENSE should
contain, a review of the many recipes available showed many
variations. The various LICENSE strings contained everything from
python abstract syntaxt tree parsable values to values that one would
have little hope of gaining meaningful data from. There was a
convention that was commonly used within the community; however the
convention had many variations, some less correct than others. This
wasn't the problem of the developer who wrote the recipe. It was a
community failure to define a standard. 
</P>
<P>As little prior work was actually done with the LICENSE variable
outside of checking for it's existence, there was no particular
concern about a standard for that variable. Much trouble could have
been avoided had a project wide agreed upon standard been developed
early on. 
</P>
<P>The next lesson is a bit more general and speaks to an issue seen
not only within the Yocto Project but can also be applied to other
large scale projects that are systems design specific. It is the one
of the most important things developers can do to limit the amount of
effort duplication, refactoring and churn their project encounters. 
</P>
<P>If you think you've spent enough time on architectural design, you
probably haven't. If you think you haven't spent enough time on
architectural design, you definitely haven't. Spending more time on
front end planning won't stop you from later having to rip apart code
or even do major architectural changes, but it will certainly reduce
the amount of effort duplication needed in the long run. Designing
your software to be as modular as possible knowing that you will end
up revisiting areas for anything from minor tweaks to major rewrites
will make it so that when you do run into these issues, code rewrites
are less hair raising.  
</P>
<P>Some obvious places where this would have helped is identifying
the needs of end users with low memory systems. Had more thought been
put into bitbake's datastore earlier, perhaps we could have predicted
the problems associated with the datestore taking up too much memory
and dealt with it earlier. 
</P>
<P>The lesson here is that while it is nearly impossible to identify
every pain point your project will run into during it's lifetime,
taking the time to do serious front end planning will help reduce the
effort needed later. BitBake, OE-Core and Yocto are all fortunate in
this regard as there was a fair amount of architectural planning done
early. This enabled us to be able to do major changes to the
architecture without too much pain and suffering.
